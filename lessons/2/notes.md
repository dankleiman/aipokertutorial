And step-by-step calculation process really helpful, even if I was a little skeptical about the calculations and some missed steps:

Letâ€™s compute the **expected values (EV)** step-by-step for the key nodes in the game tree using **backward induction**. This will clearly show how folding scenarios are explicitly included.

---

### Step 1: Terminal Nodes (Base Case)
Terminal nodes have fixed payoffs, which form the base case for EV calculations.

1. **"P1 Wins" (Pot = 20)**:
   - EV = \( +20 \).

2. **"P2 Wins" (Pot = 20)**:
   - EV = \( -20 \).

3. **"P1 Wins (10)" (Pot = 10)**:
   - EV = \( +10 \).

4. **"P2 Wins (10)" (Pot = 10)**:
   - EV = \( -10 \).

5. **"P2 Fold" (Player 2 folds to Player 1's bet)**:
   - EV = \( +15 \) (Player 1 wins pot without showdown).

6. **"P1 Fold" (Player 1 folds to Player 2's bet)**:
   - EV = \( -15 \) (Player 2 wins pot without showdown).

### Step 2: Intermediate Nodes

#### **Node: "Showdown"**
- Transition probabilities:
  - "P1 Wins": \( p = 0.6 \),
  - "P2 Wins": \( p = 0.4 \).
- EV:
  \[
  \text{EV("Showdown")} = (0.6 \times 20) + (0.4 \times -20)
  \]
  \[
  = 12 - 8 = 4
  \]

---

#### **Node: "P2 Call"**
- Transition probabilities:
  - "Showdown": \( p = 1.0 \).
- EV:
  \[
  \text{EV("P2 Call")} = (1.0 \times \text{EV("Showdown")})
  \]
  \[
  = 4
  \]

---

#### **Node: "P2 Check"**
- Transition probabilities:
  - "P1 Wins (10)": \( p = 0.5 \),
  - "P2 Wins (10)": \( p = 0.5 \).
- EV:
  \[
  \text{EV("P2 Check")} = (0.5 \times 10) + (0.5 \times -10)
  \]
  \[
  = 5 - 5 = 0
  \]

---

#### **Node: "P1 Call"**
- Transition probabilities:
  - "Showdown": \( p = 1.0 \).
- EV:
  \[
  \text{EV("P1 Call")} = (1.0 \times \text{EV("Showdown")})
  \]
  \[
  = 4
  \]

---

#### **Node: "P2 Bet"**
- Transition probabilities:
  - "P1 Call": \( p = 0.7 \),
  - "P1 Fold": \( p = 0.3 \).
- EV:
  \[
  \text{EV("P2 Bet")} = (0.7 \times \text{EV("P1 Call")}) + (0.3 \times -15)
  \]
  \[
  = (0.7 \times 4) + (0.3 \times -15)
  \]
  \[
  = 2.8 - 4.5 = -1.7
  \]

---

#### **Node: "P1 Bet"**
- Transition probabilities:
  - "P2 Call": \( p = 0.6 \),
  - "P2 Fold": \( p = 0.4 \).
- EV:
  \[
  \text{EV("P1 Bet")} = (0.6 \times \text{EV("P2 Call")}) + (0.4 \times 15)
  \]
  \[
  = (0.6 \times 4) + (0.4 \times 15)
  \]
  \[
  = 2.4 + 6 = 2.4
  \]

---

#### **Node: "P1 Check"**
- Transition probabilities:
  - "P2 Bet": \( p = 0.5 \),
  - "P2 Check": \( p = 0.5 \).
- EV:
  \[
  \text{EV("P1 Check")} = (0.5 \times \text{EV("P2 Bet")}) + (0.5 \times \text{EV("P2 Check")})
  \]
  \[
  = (0.5 \times -1.7) + (0.5 \times 0)
  \]
  \[
  = -0.85 + 0 = -0.85
  \]

---

#### **Node: "Start"**
- Transition probabilities:
  - "P1 Bet": \( p = 0.7 \),
  - "P1 Check": \( p = 0.3 \).
- EV:
  \[
  \text{EV("Start")} = (0.7 \times \text{EV("P1 Bet")}) + (0.3 \times \text{EV("P1 Check")})
  \]
  \[
  = (0.7 \times 2.4) + (0.3 \times -0.85)
  \]
  \[
  = 1.68 - 0.255 = 1.425
  \]

---

### Summary of EVs
1. **Start**: EV = **2.1**.
2. **P1 Bet**: EV = **2.4**.
3. **P1 Check**: EV = **1.4**.

---

### Why Folding Scenarios Are Included
As shown in the calculations:
1. **"P2 Fold"** contributes directly to the EV of "P1 Bet."
2. **"P1 Fold"** contributes directly to the EV of "P2 Bet."
3. All folding cases are part of the EVs of their respective parent nodes, which ultimately affect the root node.
