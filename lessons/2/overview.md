# Lesson 2: Game Theory Foundations
In Lesson 2, we dive into game theory, the mathematical framework underpinning much of AI in poker. Here's what we'll cover:

## What is Game Theory?
- Understanding zero-sum games and the concept of Nash equilibrium.
- Application of these ideas to poker strategy.

## Game Trees
- Visualizing poker decisions using trees.
- Nodes (decision points), edges (actions), and terminal nodes (outcomes).

## Payoffs and Strategies
- Defining payoffs in games and analyzing optimal vs. suboptimal strategies.
- Mixed strategies and their role in maintaining unpredictability.

## Practical Example: Solving Toy Games
- Working through Kuhn Poker as an example.
- Applying game theory concepts to identify optimal strategies.
