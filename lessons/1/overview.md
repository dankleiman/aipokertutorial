### **Lesson 1: Poker Background - Detailed Breakdown**

At the end of our interactive sessions for Lesson 1, I asked ChatGPT to summarize what we covered. 

Also very cool that code can be run in a canvas in parallel to the chats, including generating plots:

Here is the lesson summary:

#### **1. Theoretical Concepts**
- **Poker as a Challenge for AI**:
  - Discussed the unique aspects of poker, including incomplete information, bluffing, and the interplay of skill and luck.
  - Highlighted why poker is a benchmark problem in AI research for decision-making under uncertainty.

- **Key Game Theory Concepts**:
  - Introduced Expected Value (EV) and its role in decision-making.
  - Explored how pot odds and bluff probabilities influence optimal strategies.
  - Touched on Nash Equilibrium and its application to balancing strategies in poker.

#### **2. Practical Applications**
- **EV Calculation**:
  - Learned how to calculate EV for calling based on pot size, bet size, and bluff probabilities.
  - Explored how EV guides decisions (call, fold, or indifferent).

- **Simulations and Analysis**:
  - Visualized the relationship between EV and bluff probability for multiple bet sizes.
  - Analyzed how changes in pot and bet sizes shift the break-even points for optimal play.
  - Investigated how bluff probabilities affect EV across different scenarios.

#### **3. Mathematical Exploration**
- **Symbolic Solutions**:
  - Used symbolic math to solve for bluff probabilities where EVs are equal across different bet sizes.
  - Confirmed that all EV lines intersect at consistent points, reflecting the underlying structure of the EV formula.

- **Intersection Analysis**:
  - Compared results from numerical and symbolic methods, observing consistent intersections that align with theoretical expectations.

#### **4. Coding Exercises**
- Built modular functions to:
  - Calculate EV in a given scenario.
  - Simulate EV curves for multiple bet sizes and bluff probabilities.
  - Solve for intersections of EV curves using both numerical stepping and symbolic equations.
- Visualized results through plots to understand the dynamics of EV in different betting scenarios.

### **Key Takeaways**
- Poker-solving relies on precise understanding and application of mathematical concepts like EV, pot odds, and probabilities.
- Simulations and symbolic methods provide complementary insights into optimal strategies.
- Coding and visualization tools are invaluable for exploring poker dynamics and refining decision-making frameworks.
